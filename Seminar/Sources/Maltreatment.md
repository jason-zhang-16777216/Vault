Maltreatment, child welfare, and recidivism in a sample of deep-end crossover youth
# Summary
- Analyzes the effect of the "timing of child welfare invovlement" on recidivism of instituionalized juvenile offenders
- Sample of 12 955 youths in juvenile justice
- Timespan of 01/01/2010-30/06/2013
- Diverse sample
- Additionally explores "direct effects of childhood traumatic events on delinquency, as well as their indirect effects through child welfare involvement using structural equation modeling."
## About ACEs
  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) do not exert a direct effect on recidivism in adolescents
  - ACEs exert an indirect effect on recidivism
  - Child welfare involvement has a direct effect on recidivism
## Conclusions
  - ACEs have a significant effect on child welfare placement
  - Child welfare placement in turn has a significant effect on recidivism
    - This effect is only present in white and hispanic youths, not black
  - Only Hispanic females and White males zwith both child welfare and juvenile justice cases were more likely to recidivate than delinquent-only counterpart
  - [[Crossover]] status was essentially irrelevant for black youths
  - Exposure to ACEs, child welfare, and juvenile justice's effect on recidivism is non-uniform
  - When it does matter, earlier child welfare involvement is more detrimental than current

# Assessment
- Peer reviewed, well sourced article published in a reputable journal 
- Fairly current up to ~2013 
- Statistical analysis; unlikely to be biased with the methods they used
- Uses pre-existing numerical analysies and factual relations; objective

# Criticism
- This paper does not give any convincing resolutions beyond:
  - Broadly encouraging communication
  - Increasing standard mental health interventions

# Scholarly? 
- Yes, lives entirely within the frameworks established by academics in their field
- builds off of previous academic study in this area 

# Credible? 
- Yes, criminology/juvenile justice expertise

# Relevancy
- Details strongly releveant to recidivism in youth 
- Slightly abstracted from mental health angle; need a source to bridge that gap
  - I need a source that shows child welfare is affects for mental health
